🎯𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:

AtliQ Hardware is growing fast and wants to use PowerBi to make better decisions and beat competitions. They asked me to help with this, and I did it as part of my Codebasics free bootcamp program.

❓𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗕𝗟𝗘𝗠 𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗧𝗘𝗠𝗘𝗡𝗧:

Atliq Hardware is struggling to gain a clear and actionable understanding of its sales performance due to the lack of a centralized, dynamic reporting system. This impedes their ability to make informed decisions for strategic growth and efficient resource allocation.

📌Key Issues:

● Limited Sales Visibility: Difficulty in comprehensively tracking overall revenue and sales quantity trends over time, hindering proactive performance assessment and intervention.

● Inefficient Product and Market Management: Challenges in identifying top-performing and underperforming products and markets, leading to suboptimal inventory, marketing, and expansion strategies.

● Inadequate Customer Insights: Inability to effectively identify and differentiate valuable customers, preventing targeted customer relationship management and personalized sales approaches.

● Reactive Decision-Making: Over-reliance on static reports results in delayed and less accurate strategic planning, as dynamic data analysis is not readily available.
